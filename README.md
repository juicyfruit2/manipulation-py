# manipulation-py

Follow these steps:
-	Create a new Python file in this folder called manipulation.py.
- Ask the user to enter a sentence using the input() method. Save the user’s response in a variable called str_manip.
-	Using this string value, write the code to do the following:
- Calculate and display the length of str_manip.
- Find the last letter in str_manip. Replace every occurrence of this letter in str_manip with ‘@’.
- e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would be: “Thi@ i@ a bunch of word@”
- Print the last 3 characters in str_manip backwards.
- e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would be: “sdr”.
- Create a five-letter word that is made up of the first three characters and the last two characters in str_manip.

- e.g. if str_manip = “This is a bunch of words”, the output would be: “Thids”.
- Display each word on a new line.
